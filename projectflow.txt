1. Create git repo and clone it in local
2. Create code.py and code to it
3. Do git add commit -push before Initi dvc
4. Now we do 'dvc init' (Create .dvcignore,.dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S#"(just to create s# directory -you can named any)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S#"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it wil ask to do :("git rm -r -cached 'data'" and "git commit -m 'Stop tracking data'")
   Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remote it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc".
9.Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. do a git addd -commit -push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11.Now make change to code.py to append a new row in data , check changes via "dvc status"
12 again --"dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
